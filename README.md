# wave_1d_fd_tf
1D finite difference wave propagation implemented using TensorFlow

This is a simple 1D scalar wave equation propagator, primarily implemented to
test its performance compared to my
[previous](https://github.com/ar4/wave_1d_fd_perf/blob/master/notebooks/wave_1d_fd_perf.ipynb)
implementations using Python, Numba, C, and Fortran.

See the
[notebook](https://github.com/ar4/wave_1d_fd_tf/blob/master/notebooks/wave_1d_fd_tf.ipynb)
for the results and discussion.
